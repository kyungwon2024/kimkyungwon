                Hello world. <strong>Social Business Is <u>Dead</u>.</strong> But dont order up a casket quite yet.The King is dead … Long live the King!
            
            Signifying an immediate transition of power, this phrase is used to commemorate the passing of power from one royal leader to his (or her!) successor.

            </p><p style="margin-top:45px;">We are at a transition point with respect to social business. The old regime is passing away and transitioning to something new. I'm not predicting a demise of any of the major social business players, but the rules of the game are changing — and social business professionals should be aware of these changes.</p>
            
            The first sign that something important was changing in social business came during my interview with Blake Chandlee of Facebook. He intentionally referred to Facebook as a digital company, not a social one. When the 600-pound gorilla of the social media world begins to think of itself as something more than just a social business, something important is going on.
